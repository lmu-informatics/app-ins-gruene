Guide for future work:

- Better positioning of the imprint button (currently in the recyclerview of the overview fragment)
- Adding the correct game ids in the "tree.xml" for all trees (only "Ahorn" is representative at the moment, all other trees are filled with random ids. See "ZusammenfassungMinigames.pdf")
- Creation of a database for the entire content of the minigames (e.g. the quiz questions and answers -> they are all in the minigames_chooseanswer-xml a.t.m)
- Make up text for games like "input_string" and "only_description" -> use database
- Adding content of all games for all trees, e.g. the puzzle images (currently just "Ahorn") -> use database
- Improving the slideshow in "Steckbrief" (currently there are predefined pictures displayed, but the goal is to show fotos which are taken during the game "Foto-Challenge")
- Fotos of "Foto-Challenge" also have to show up inside the cards of "Steckbrief"
- Information given in "Steckbrief" has to be checked for correctness, maybe there are details missing?
- Creation of not implemented minigames of "ZusammenfassungMinigames.pdf" 
- Testing app and handle bugs
- Maybe testing the app with children of the target group for getting feedback

-> Finally, publish the app in the google play store an GG!
