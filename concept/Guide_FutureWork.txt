Future work:


Features:
- Implementing a "help-button" 
- Links to videos of bisa 
- Let popup window be displayed in every minigame (currently just in "Quiz" and "Foto-Challenge"). Maybe create a new popup-class to handle all popups?
- Improving the slideshow in "Steckbrief" (currently there are predefined pictures displayed, but the goal is to show fotos which are taken during the game "Foto-Challenge")
- Fotos of "Foto-Challenge" also have to show up inside the cards of "Steckbrief"
- Creation of not implemented minigames of "ZusammenfassungMinigames.pdf"

Content:
- Creation of a database for the entire content of the minigames (e.g. the quiz questions and answers -> they are all in the minigames_chooseanswer-xml a.t.m)
- Adding the correct game ids in the "tree.xml" for all trees (only "Ahorn" is representative at the moment, all other trees are filled with random ids. See "ZusammenfassungMinigames.pdf")
- Make up text for games like "input_string" and "only_description" -> use database
- Adding content of all games for all trees, e.g. the puzzle images (currently just "Ahorn") -> use database
- Information given in "Steckbrief" has to be checked for correctness, maybe there are details missing?

Front-End:
- Better positioning of the imprint button (currently in the recyclerview of the overview fragment)

Known bugs: 
- "Steckbrief" arrow not working correctly
- "TakePicture": foto has to scale and rotate correctly


Finalization:
- Check if the app is shown correctly for different screen sizes, portrait mode etc.
- Adding cosmetic features like little animation for icons (wiggle, shake, etc.)
- Testing app and handle bugs
- Maybe testing the app with children of the target group for getting feedback



-> Finally, publish the app in the google play store an GG!
